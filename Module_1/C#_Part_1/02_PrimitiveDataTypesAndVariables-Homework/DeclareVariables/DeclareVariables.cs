//Problem 1. Declare Variables

//Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
//Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.
//Submit the source code of your Visual Studio project as part of your homework submission.


namespace DeclareVariables
{
    using System;

    class DeclareVariables
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            ushort a = 52130;
            sbyte b = -115;
            int c = 48259;
            byte d = 97;
            int e = -10000;

            Console.WriteLine("{0} {1} {2} {3} {4}", a, b, c, e, d);
        }
